Adding callbacks to sliders

Callbacks are functions that a user can define, like def callback(attr, old, new), that can be called automatically when some property of a Bokeh object (e.g., the value of a Slider) changes.

How are callbacks added for the value property of Slider objects?

() By passing a callback function to the callback method.
(x) By passing a callback function to the on_change method.
() By assigning the callback function to the Slider.update property.

Correct. A callback is added by calling myslider.on_change('value', callback).
