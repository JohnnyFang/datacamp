Possible Answers

()    All I. versicolor petals are shorter than I. virginica petals.
()    I. setosa petals have a broader range of lengths than the other two species.
(x)    I. virginica petals tend to be the longest, and I. setosa petals tend to be the shortest of the three species.
()    I. versicolor is a hybrid of I. virginica and I. setosa.

// Correct! Notice that we said "tend to be." Some individual I. virginica flowers may be shorter than individual I. versicolor flowers. It is also possible that an individual I. setosa flower may have longer petals than in individual I. versicolor flower, though this is highly unlikely, and was not observed by Anderson.
